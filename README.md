# Q.1: You are part of a development team working on a Python application called "CalculatorPlus." The application provides basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Your task is to implement a new feature that adds support for calculating the square root of a number.
Step 1:
 # On GitHub, create a new repository called git_assignment_HeroVired_RajaV and clone it locally.
Step 2 :
# Create and switch to the 'dev' branch
Step 3:
# Python file added 'calculator.py' and tested successfully
Step 4:
# Switched to the 'dev' branch, added the Python file, and committed and pushed:

Step 5:
# Merge this branch with the main branch and make a release of version 1 of the ‘calculator plus app’.

Step 5:
# Switch to the new branch called 'feature/sqrt' and After changes made from Python code( uncommented the Square root code ) and Commit & Push changes

Step 6:
# While you are working on this feature, imagine that one critical bug is reported in the main branch, and you need to switch back to the ‘dev’ branch, create fixes, and apply them while keeping your ‘feature/sqrt’ branch up-to-date. For this, you need to create

Step 7: 
# After completing the feature implementation and ensuring that the application works correctly, create a pull request targeting the main branch.
Step 8;
# Request a code review from a team member and make any necessary improvements based on the review feedback.

Step 9:
# Finally, do the testing in the ‘dev’ branch itself and merge it into the ‘main’ branch and create a ‘version 2’ release

# Q.2: For a project that deals with large binary files, integrate Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle these files efficiently. Demonstrate how to add, commit, and push binary files to the repository, ensuring they are tracked by Git LFS correctly. Clone the repository on another machine to verify that the binary files are downloaded correctly.
 # In the repository ‘git_assignment_HeroVired’, create a branch ‘lfs’. Upload any large file whose size is over ‘200mb’ and try to push this file into the repository.

 Step 1:
 # After Clone the repo - "git_assignment_HeroVired_RajaV" . Switched to the lfs branch
 Step 2:
 # Track the LFS files and add the Large files(.mp4 format)

# Q.3: In this same GitHub repository, create a new branch ‘geometry-calculator’, we'll work on a simple Python program that calculates the area of a circle and the area of a rectangle. We'll use Git stash to switch between working on multiple features (calculating circle area and calculating rectangle area) without committing incomplete changes.


Step 1:
# Create feature/circle-area branch
Output :
<img width="1756" height="67" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d1089a2-336c-45de-979a-534367f9a7b3" />
Step 2:
# Added the geometry_calculator python file
Output :

Step 3:
# Before committing the changes, stash them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation and Verify working directory is clean.
Output :

Step 4:
# Create a new branch named "feature/rectangle-area" to work on the rectangle area
Output :
<img width="1726" height="302" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cf2590c-e04a-428d-b13a-e2da6a739d2f" />
Step 5:
# Before committing the changes, stash them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation and Verify working directory is clean.
Output :

Step 6:
# Switch back to the "feature/circle-area" branch to continue working on the circle area feature. Retrieve the stashed changes .Complete the circle area feature implementation and save the changes. 
Output :
